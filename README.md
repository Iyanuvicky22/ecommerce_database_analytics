Project: E-commerce Backend System with PostgreSQL & FastAPI
Project Overview
As a data engineer for an e-commerce website, you are given a CSV dataset containing raw transactional data. Your task is to design and implement a robust data pipeline that efficiently processes, stores, and exposes insights from this data. To achieve this, you first model the data into four key tables: Orders, Customers, Products, and Order Items. The Customers table holds user details, while the Products table contains product information. The Orders table tracks each transaction, linking customers to their purchases, and the Order Items table breaks down each order into individual product purchases, capturing quantities and prices. Once the schema is defined, you store the structured data in a PostgreSQL database, optimizing it with indexing and foreign key relationships for efficient queries. Next, you perform various computations, such as calculating total sales, customer lifetime value, and product performance metrics, directly in the database. To expose this data, you build a FastAPI endpoint that allows users to query and visualize key analytics, such as top-selling products, customer purchase behavior, and revenue trends.

Prerequisites:
Before starting this project, you should:

Have basic knowledge of SQL (SELECT, INSERT, JOIN, INDEXING).
Understand relational databases and how tables relate via foreign keys.
Be familiar with Python, particularly working with Pandas, FASTAPI and SQLAlchemy.
Have PostgreSQL installed and running on your system.
Goal:
Design a relational database based on the dataset.
Load the provided CSV data into PostgreSQL.
Write SQL queries for business insights.
Expose API endpoints with FastAPI.
Implement indexing and optimization.
Use SQLAlchemy ORM for queries and operations.
Document the API with Swagger UI (/docs)
Dataset Information
https://github.com/Data-Epic/database-fundamentals/blob/main/data/ecommerce_dataset.csv. This dataset simulates real-world e-commerce transactions with columns like:

Order details (Order_Date, Order_Priority, Payment_method)
Customer information (Customer_id, Gender, Device_Type, Customer_Login_Type)
Product information (Product_Category, Product, Quantity, Discount, Sales)
Financial information (Profit, Shipping_cost)

Tasks
🔹 Task 1: Define the PostgreSQL Database Schema
Create a database named ecommerce_db.
Define tables in SQLAlchemy ORM:
🔹 Task 2: Load the CSV Data into PostgreSQL
Write a script (scripts/load_data.py) to import ecommerce_dataset.csv into the four different PostgreSQL tables created above..
Ensure proper data type conversions (dates, decimals, etc.).
Handle duplicates using ON CONFLICT to avoid inserting the same customers multiple times.
🔹 Task 3: Write SQL Queries for Business Insights
Write SQL queries to analyze e-commerce performance:

1️⃣ Customer Insights

Total number of unique customers.
Number of customers per device type (Web/Mobile).
Percentage of members vs. guest users.
2️⃣ Product Performance

Top 5 best-selling products based on sales.
Top 3 product categories with the highest revenue.
Products with the highest profit margins.
3️⃣ Order Analysis

Average order size (quantity per order).
Total revenue and profit.
Percentage of orders placed with High or Critical priority.
4️⃣ Discount Impact

Does higher discount % lead to more sales?
(Hint: Compare Sales vs. Discount using GROUP BY discount)*
🔹 Task 4: Expose API Endpoints with FastAPI
Develop the following REST API endpoints:

Endpoint	Method	Description
/customers/	GET	Get all customers
/customers/{customer_id}	GET	Get details of a specific customer
/orders/	GET	Get all orders
/orders/{order_id}	GET	Get details of a specific order
/products/	GET	Get all products
/analytics/top-products/	GET	Get top-selling products
/analytics/revenue/	GET	Get total revenue & profit
Use SQLAlchemy ORM to interact with PostgreSQL.
Document all endpoints in Swagger UI (/docs).
🔹 Task 5: Implement Indexing & Query Optimization
Create an index on high-frequency search columns:
CREATE INDEX idx_order_customer ON Orders(customer_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_product_sales ON OrderItems(product_id);
Explain how indexing improves query performance.
Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to compare indexed vs. non-indexed queries.
